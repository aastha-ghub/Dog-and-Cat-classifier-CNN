# Dog-and-Cat-classifier-CNN
Classifying Dog and Cat using CNN on Tensorflow 2.x

Problem Statement

Dataset: 

The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat 
It was only effectively addressed in the last few years using deep learning convolutional neural networks. While the dataset is effectively solved, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification


Tasks to be Performed

We will be performing the following tasks:

Prepare the dataset for the model

Install Tensorflow 2.x

Develop convolutional neural network model for classifying the images or Dog Vs cat

Plot the change in accuracy per epochs

Evaluate the model on the testing data

Analyse the model summary

Add Dropout to prevent overfitting and check its effect on accuracy

Increasing the number of Hidden Layers check its effect on accuracy

Manipulate the batch_size and epochs and check its effect on accuracy

Dataset Description

The Dog Vs Cat image classification dataset consists of 8005 images belonging to 2 classes for training images and 2023 images belonging to 2 classes for testing images


Class I = Dog

Class II= Cat
